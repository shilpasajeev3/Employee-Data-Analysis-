# Employee Dataset Analysis
This project provides a dataset of employees working at a Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The dataset includes information such as name, team, number, position, age, height, weight, college, and salary.
## Getting Started
To begin the analysis, the dataset is imported using the Pandas library, and initial exploration is performed.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset is explored to understand its structure and contents. The data includes details about employees, such as name, team, position, age, height, weight, college, and salary.
## Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including changing the height data with random numbers between 150 and 180.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory data analysis is performed on the dataset, offering insights into patterns, trends, and outliers.
## Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive statistics, including count, unique values, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum, are calculated for each column.
## Analysis by Team:
The number of employees in each team is determined, along with the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. The results are presented in a DataFrame.
## Analysis by Position:
The count of employees in each position (SG, PF, PG, SF, C) is obtained, showcasing the distribution of employees across different roles.
## Analysis by Age Group:
The age group to which most employees belong is identified, along with the corresponding number of employees.
## Highest Salary Information:
Details about the employee with the highest salary are extracted, including the team and position.
## Correlation Analysis:
A correlation matrix is computed for age and salary, and the results are visually represented through a heatmap and scatter plot. The analysis suggests a weak positive correlation between age and salary.

These analyses provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset and lay the foundation for more in-depth insights.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the employee dataset, covering team distribution, employee positions, age group analysis, highest salary insights, and age-salary correlation. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the demographics and characteristics of the employees at Company. Feel free to adapt and customize this code for your specific data analysis needs.
